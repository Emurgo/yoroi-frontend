# Domain

`Domain` represents models of our underlying domain space (blockchain). As such, they represent the bridge between our application UI logic and our `api`. The structures here are created+populated by the `api` and managed by the `stores`. 

The name `domain` comes from the `mobx` concept that your stores manage domain-specific state.
