# Project Structure

Each folder has its own README documentation but here we outline some general design

### Ada folders

Note that many parts of this project have `ada` folders in this. We try and split concerns in our application by making any Cardano-specific code be located in `ada` folders. This hopefully makes the code easier to manage if makes it easier to add more currencies in the future if that becomes a requirement.
