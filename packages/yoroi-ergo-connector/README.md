# Yoroi-Ergo dApp Connector

This experimental extension is the first in a modular design to interface the [Yoroi frontend extension](https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-frontend) with dApps. It targets the [Ergo](https://ergoplatform.org/en/) cryptocurrency.

The implementation will follow our [EIP-0012](https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/pull/23) spec.
