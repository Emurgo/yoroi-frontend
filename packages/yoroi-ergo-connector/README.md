# Yoroi dApp Connector

~~This experimental extension is the first in a modular design to interface the [Yoroi frontend extension](https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-frontend) with dApps. It targets the [Ergo](https://ergoplatform.org/en/) cryptocurrency.~~

~~The implementation will follow our [EIP-0012](https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/pull/23) spec.~~

This project is used only as an example application.

All related to the dApp is moved to the folder `packages/yoroi-extension/app/ergo-connector`.
