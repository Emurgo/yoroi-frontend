# Scenario Testing

We use [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) to create scenarios and them run them using Selenium (Chrome Web driver and Gecko Web Driver)

These tests mock the `backend-service` by spinning up a server on localhost that answers to `backend-service` requests.
No other part of the application is mocked.

Initial data to perform the tests seed by a `JSON` file.
Note: The JSON file is just miscellaneous faked data. It is
- Not a blockchain
- Not a valid state in Cardano

Each scenario is tagged with `@it-<number>` so that we can use run specific scenarios by their tags, such as `npm run test:run:tag:chrome @it-99`. To add new scenarios, pick unique numbers as tags. This command may suggest from which number to start: `grep -oh '@it-[0-9]*' features/*.feature | sort -Vr | head`.

## Exporting a Yoroi snapshot

Yoroi snapshots are created by adding the step `I export a snapshot named SNAPSHOT_NAME` and running locally the scenario once. This creates the files `localStorage.json` and `indexedDB.json` in the folder `features/yoroi_snapshots/SNAPSHOT_NAME`. Then you can import the snapshot with the  step `I import a snapshot named SNAPSHOT_NAME`.

## Local CI

Sometimes it is useful and faster to simulate running our CI on your local machine. We do this by creating the same docker container that our CI uses and locally copying your code to the docker container.

### Updating an existing LocalCI

#### Updating image

You sometimes need to update your docker image (for example get the latest version of browsers). This requires you to delete your existing image and recreate a new one
1) `docker pull -a emurgornd/circleci-node-12-browsers`
1) `docker stop yoroi_ci`
1) `docker rm yoroi_ci`
1) See instructions for setting up LocalCI for the first time

#### Starting existing image
1) Start the docker image with `docker start yoroi_ci`
1) Reconnect the image with `sudo docker exec -d yoroi_ci /bin/bash CI/connect.sh`

#### Using LocalCI

1) (ONLY FIRST TIME) `npm run localci:setup` to create the docker image.
1) `npm run localci:newbuild` whenever you make a code change
1) (MAC ONLY) `npm install` isn't compatible across operating systems you you have to delete `node_modules` inside the docker image and re-run `npm install`.
1) `npm run localci:test` to run the test (ex: `npm run localci:test test:run:e2e:chrome`)

### See LocalCI browser behavior using a virtual monitor

This localci also allows you to attach a monitor to your container to inspect visually why a test is failing. To do this, you need an application that can run a `VNC` connection. 

#### Ubuntu

If you are using Ubuntu, I suggest the following steps:
1) Run `Remmina` (comes preinstalled)
1) Set the protocol to `VNC`
1) Set `127.0.0.1` as the connection

#### Mac

1) Use Royal TSX with `VNC`
