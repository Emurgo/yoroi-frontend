# Abstract

We need to have an agreed time and method to sync developers on the state of the project.

# Motivation

We need to be able to

1) Discuss items currently in triage (green light to start implementing)
1) Discuss progress on existing tasks (accountability)
1) Discuss shipping cycle (deadlines)
1) Discuss broader priorities and vision
1) Share knowledge (help newcommers)


We need to decide a way to discuss items that are in triage and sync about items in progress. triage community issues. In this proposal we will only talk about the triage process -- not about the format feature proposals should follow.

# Background

Syncing is generally more efficiently done as a call. Many existing projects do weekly syncs like this (`Ethereum Core Devs Meeting`, `Ethereum Classic Scala Client Meeting`, etc.)

Note that 

1) Devs may be in different timezones
1) Volunteers are not expected to join every meeting
1) Too many meetings becomes unproductive

# Proposal

We will create a Github issue every week calle "Weekly Meeting Agenda"

The issue will contain:
1) A link to a poll to schedule the time of the meeting
1) A link to a online meeting to join once the meeting starts

## Poll for tmime of meeting
- A [Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/) will be used
- Meetings will be held once a week on Tuesdays (UTC) -- only time time-of-day will be up for decision in the poll.
- At least one Emurgo employee must be available at the chosen 

## Online meeting technology
- [Google Hangouts on Air](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7083786?hl=en) hosted by the the Emurgo channel
  - A Hangout On Air is limited to 10 (unless you are using Google for Work which can have 15)
- Recording will be uploaded to the Emurgo Youtube channel after the meeting

## Moderator of meeting
- Emurgo will moderate the meetings.
