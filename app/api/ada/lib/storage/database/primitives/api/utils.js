/**
 * We use Fnv32a as a hash for the following reasons
 * 1) Small enough that you can easily inline it and easily compare to reference implementation it
 * (compared to xxhash, murmur, etc. which are quite lengthy)
 * 2) It has a better distribution than naive hashing (ex: Java's hashing of strings
 * 3) For pure Javascript implementations, it's as fast as xxhash and murmur
 * See this post which shows Fnv32a does very well compared to alternatives
