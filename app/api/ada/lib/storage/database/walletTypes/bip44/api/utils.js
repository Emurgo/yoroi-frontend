 * We sometimes need to lock all level-specific derivation tables

 * However, it may not always be possible to know which derivation level will be required
 *
 * For example, it's possible a transaction includes a query that fetches which level is needed
 * follow by a query at that level.
 * Since we cannot statically determine which level will be used, we just lock all tables.
