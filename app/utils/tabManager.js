/**
 * Notify any other Yoroi tabs to close before we initialize
 * Note: for the listner to fire, the key much change values
 * To generate a new value every time, we use the current time
 *
 * The precision of the clock may be of concern. Let's look at two scenarios:
 *
 * 1) Opening Yoroi by pressing the Yoroi icon
 * In this case, Chrome & Firefox only allows you to load one copy of Yoroi at the same time.
 * This restriction applies even across multiple copies of Chrome running at the same time
 * (however this restriction can probabilistically fail if you mash the Yoroi logo very fast)
 * Since Yoroi takes more than a millisecond to open, the time should bee unique.
 *
 * 2) Manually entering the Yoroi URL into a page multiple times
 * This bypasses above-mentioned restriction of only one copy loading at once
 * Emperically, this doesn't seem to be an issue though.
 *
 * WARNING: You should only call this AFTER the wasm bindings have loaded
 * closing a different copy of Yoroi while loading WASM causes the load to hang
 * This bug only exists in Chrome (verified still occurs in Chrome v75)
 *
 * WARNING: You should call this function BEFORE making any other changes to localstorage
