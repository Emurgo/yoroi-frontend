## 12. Términos Especiales: Red de Prueba Incentivada, Delegación y Staking

12.1 **Red de Prueba Incentivada.** La empresa está probando y poniendo a disposición de los Usuarios un mecanismo de recompensas e incentivos de prueba que tiene por objeto imitar el mecanismo de recompensas e incentivos del próximo lanzamiento de Shelley (la "**Red de Prueba Incentivada"**). Los usuarios pueden participar en la Red de Prueba Incentivada delegando su participación de ADA en su propio stake pool o en un stake pool de terceros a cambio de una recompensa equivalente a un porcentaje de los ingresos generados por el stake pool ("**Recompensa"**).

12.2 **Recompensas.** La cuantía de las recompensas que un Usuario puede obtener por la delegación depende de diversos factores, entre ellos, la participación de los usuarios, los márgenes de beneficio de los stake pools y el volumen de ADA que se delega. Es posible que la delegación no genere ninguna Recompensa para un Usuario debido a los factores mencionados. Las recompensas se obtienen en la blockchain de Cardano a partir del comienzo del 3er epoch. Cuando la Red de Prueba Incentivada concluya, toda Recompensa obtenida podrá ser transferida de nuevo a la billetera de Daedalus o Yoroi del usuario.

12.3 **Delegation.** Users may delegate their stake to one of the various stake pools of the Company or to a third party stake pool. User will have the sole right to determine the volume to be delegated to a stake pool and may increase or decrease its level of participation at any time. Any information Company shares regarding stakepools, including performance metrics and Rewards, will be for indicative purposes only and may not be accurate. Users may only delegate their stake to a stake pool if their ada is in an updated Daedalus or an updated Yoroi wallet at the time of the setup process. User does not acquire any automatic right to Rewards as a result of delegating its stake.

12.4 **Company Stake-Pools.** The Company will operate various stake pools which will be visible in Yoroi or Seiza. The cost and network and server requirements to reliably operate such stake pools shall be determined by the Company in its sole discretion. Company will communicate the percentage amount of Reward to be shared with Users through the User’s Testnet Yoroi wallet. Rewards will accrue at the end of each epoch and will automatically appear in the User’s Testnet Yoroi wallet. Company will provide a dashboard detailing the Company’s staking performance to User.

12.5 **Redeeming Rewards.** User acknowledges and agrees that by redeeming Rewards in the Incentivised Testnet, User redeems TEST-ADA only, and that in order to redeem actual ada, User must repeat the procedure in the mainnet, once released. User shall be responsible for payment of all applicable taxes, if any, to which the Rewards might be subject and any and all other taxes which may apply to User once Rewards are redeemed.

12.6 **Tools.** Company will provide Users and stake pool operators certain tools designed to estimate the amount of Rewards a User may earn on the Incentivized Testnet. User understands that these tools are provided for illustrative purposes only and may not be accurate. Company does not promise that the Reward received will correspond to the amount indicated by the tools or by the stake pools.

12.7 **Prohibited Use.** User will not, and will not permit any other third party to use any device, software or routine to interfere with the proper function of the Incentivised Testnet. If there is a complaint or notice of violation, a User’s participation may be suspended without notice until resolved, and terminated if not resolved promptly.

12.8 **Warranty.** The Service are provided to User on an "as is" and "as available" basis and all warranties, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service are hereby excluded. User acknowledges that the Incentivized Testnet may not operate properly and that it may contain errors, design flaws or other issues. User’s use of the Incentivized Testnet remains at User’s risk and discretion. EMURGO reserves the right to restart the Incentivised Testnet and reverse all or some Rewards in the case of errors and/or malicious behaviour in the system.

12.9 **Termination of the Incentivised Testnet.** User understands and agrees that Company may change, withdraw, terminate access to and/or discontinue the Incentivized Testnet (or any portion thereof) at any time and in its sole discretion. User may end participation in the Incentivized Testnet at any time and any Rewards gained up to that time will still be transferred to User’s Daedalus or Yoroi mainet wallet once the Incentivized Testnet is discontinued.

12.10 **Feedback.** Users may provide suggestions, comments or ideas and report issues or problems related to their use of the Incentivized Testnet at any time by using any of the official feedback channels.
