## 12. 特殊条款 - 激励测试网，授权和抵押

12.1 **激励测试网** 公司正在测试并向用户提供测试奖励和激励机制，该机制旨在模仿即将发布的Shelley版本中的奖励和激励机制 ("**激励测试网**")。用户可以通过将其ada权益授权给自己的权益池或第三方权益池来参与激励测试网，以换取权益池产生收益中与用户权益百分比相等的奖励 ("**奖励**")。

12.2 **奖励** 用户可以从授权中获得的奖励金额取决于多种因素，包括但不限于用户参与度，权益池利润率和被授权的ada数量。基于上述因素，授权可能不会为用户产生任何奖励。奖励是从在Cardano区块链授权后第三个纪元开始时开始计算。激励测试网结束后，获得的所有奖励都可以转回到用户的Daedalus或Yoroi钱包中。

12.3 **授权** 用户可以将其权益授权给公司的各种权益池之一或第三方权益池。用户将拥有唯一的权力来确定要授权给权益池的数量，并且可以随时增加或减少其参与程度。公司分享的有关权益池的任何信息，包括绩效指标和奖励，仅用于指导目的，可能不准确。在设置过程中，如果其ada存在于更新的Daedalus或更新的Yoroi钱包中，则用户只能将其权益授权给一个权益池。用户由于授权其权益而没有奖励的任何自动权利。

12.4 **Company Stake-Pools.** The Company will operate various stake pools which will be visible in Yoroi or Seiza. The cost and network and server requirements to reliably operate such stake pools shall be determined by the Company in its sole discretion. Company will communicate the percentage amount of Reward to be shared with Users through the User’s Testnet Yoroi wallet. Rewards will accrue at the end of each epoch and will automatically appear in the User’s Testnet Yoroi wallet. Company will provide a dashboard detailing the Company’s staking performance to User.

12.5 **Redeeming Rewards.** User acknowledges and agrees that by redeeming Rewards in the Incentivised Testnet, User redeems TEST-ADA only, and that in order to redeem actual ada, User must repeat the procedure in the mainnet, once released. User shall be responsible for payment of all applicable taxes, if any, to which the Rewards might be subject and any and all other taxes which may apply to User once Rewards are redeemed.

12.6 **Tools.** Company will provide Users and stake pool operators certain tools designed to estimate the amount of Rewards a User may earn on the Incentivized Testnet. User understands that these tools are provided for illustrative purposes only and may not be accurate. Company does not promise that the Reward received will correspond to the amount indicated by the tools or by the stake pools.

12.7 **Prohibited Use.** User will not, and will not permit any other third party to use any device, software or routine to interfere with the proper function of the Incentivised Testnet. If there is a complaint or notice of violation, a User’s participation may be suspended without notice until resolved, and terminated if not resolved promptly.

12.8 **Warranty.** The Service are provided to User on an "as is" and "as available" basis and all warranties, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service are hereby excluded. User acknowledges that the Incentivized Testnet may not operate properly and that it may contain errors, design flaws or other issues. User’s use of the Incentivized Testnet remains at User’s risk and discretion. EMURGO reserves the right to restart the Incentivised Testnet and reverse all or some Rewards in the case of errors and/or malicious behaviour in the system.

12.9 **Termination of the Incentivised Testnet.** User understands and agrees that Company may change, withdraw, terminate access to and/or discontinue the Incentivized Testnet (or any portion thereof) at any time and in its sole discretion. User may end participation in the Incentivized Testnet at any time and any Rewards gained up to that time will still be transferred to User’s Daedalus or Yoroi mainet wallet once the Incentivized Testnet is discontinued.

12.10 **反馈** 用户可以通过任何官方反馈渠道随时提供建议，评论或想法，并报告与使用激励测试网有关的问题。
