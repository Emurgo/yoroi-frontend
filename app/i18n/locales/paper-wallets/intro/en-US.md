# Paper Wallets

A **"Paper Wallet"** is a special document, containing secret mnemonics words and a small set of addresses.
When a paper wallet is created **it is NOT stored by Yoroi**.
The generated PDF document is the only copy of this wallet in existence.

You can use a paper wallet to receive coins using the pre-generated addresses.
You can restore your paper wallet at any time into Yoroi to access the funds.
However, you should stop using a paper wallet after you restore its funds as it will no longer be a "cold" wallet.

Yoroi Paper Wallets are protected with a **custom user password** and contain 21 secret words.
Even if someone gets access to this paper-wallet, they will also need to know your password to gain access to the funds.
**But if you lose or forget your password, your funds will be lost forever and no one will be able to restore them**.
Typing the wrong wallet password will give you a different wallet. This allows for plausible deniability.
