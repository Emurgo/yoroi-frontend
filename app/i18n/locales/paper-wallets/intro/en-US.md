# Paper Wallets

A **"Paper Wallet"** is a special document, containing secret mnemonics words
and one or few addresses. When a paper wallet is created - **it is NOT linked
to your computer, and full wallet key is NOT stored in computer memory**.
When you print out a paper wallet and delete the PDF document - the print-outs
are the only copies of this wallet in the whole world.

You can use a paper wallet to receive coins and store them for any period of time
(using the addresses on the document). At any moment - you can use a paper wallet
to restore a regular digital wallet in Yoroi, and this wallet will give you access
yo all the funds you have sent to printed addresses.

Yoroi allows creating two types of paper wallets:
- Regular paper wallet with 30 secret words. 21 word is printed out and 9 words are written manually.
If someone gets access to this paper-wallet - they have full access to any funds you have sent there.
- Password-protected paper wallet with 21 secret word. You are setting your own custom password
for this type and you need to remember it very carefully. If someone gets access to this paper-wallet -
they will also need to find your password to gain access to the funds. 

When you restore a paper wallet back into Yoroi and get access to your funds -
you supposed to throw away or destroy the document itself, because it is now
meaningless after already being exposed into a computer.
