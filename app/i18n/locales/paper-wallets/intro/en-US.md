# Paper Wallets

A **"Paper Wallet"** is a special document, containing secret mnemonics words
and one or few addresses. When a paper wallet is created - **it is NOT linked
to your computer, and full wallet key is NOT stored in computer memory**.
When you print out a paper wallet and delete the PDF document - the print-outs
are the only copies of this wallet in the whole world.

You can use a paper wallet to receive coins and store them for any period of time
(using the addresses on the document). At any moment - you can use a paper wallet
to restore a regular digital wallet in Yoroi, and this wallet will give you access
yo all the funds you have sent to printed addresses.

Yoroi Paper Wallets are protected with a **custom user password** and contain 21 secret word.
You are setting your own custom password and you need to remember it very carefully.
If someone gets access to this paper-wallet - they will also need to find your password
to gain access to the funds. **But if you lost or forget your password - your funds will be
lost forever and no one will be able to restore them!** 

When you restore a paper wallet back into Yoroi and get access to your funds -
you supposed to throw away or destroy the document itself, because it is now
meaningless after already being exposed into a computer.
