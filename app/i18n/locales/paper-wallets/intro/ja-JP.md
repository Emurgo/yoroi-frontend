# ペーパーウォレット

**ペーパーウォレット**は、秘密鍵となる言葉とアドレスが記載された特別な文書です。ペーパーウォレットを作成する場合、**ヨロイはこれを保存しません**。生成されたPDF文書のみがウォレットの控となります。

You can use a paper wallet to receive coins using the pre-generated addresses. You can restore your paper wallet at any time into Yoroi to access the funds. However, you should stop using a paper wallet after you restore its funds as it will no longer be a "cold" wallet.

Yoroi Paper Wallets are protected with a **custom user password** and contain 21 secret words. Even if someone gets access to this paper-wallet, they will also need to know your password to gain access to the funds. **But if you lose or forget your password, your funds will be lost forever and no one will be able to restore them!**. Typing the wrong wallet password will give you a different wallet. This allows for plausible deniability.
