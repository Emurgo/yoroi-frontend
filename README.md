# Yoroi - Cardano ADA wallet
  
  We use as template for this repository: [React Chrome Extension Boilerplate](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-chrome-extension-boilerplate)

## Installation

```bash
# clone the repository with the submodule js-cardano-wasm
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:Emurgo/yoroi-frontend.git
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Prerequisites

#### Install NodeJS
- node [v8.9.4](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v8.9.4/) (if you are using nvm, just execute: `$ nvm use`)

#### Install rust tools
```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
Tested on the latest 1.30.1 version of rust and 1.14.0 of rustup.
Don't forget to configure your current shell run for _rustup_:
```bash
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
```
Toolchain install:
```bash
$ rustup install nightly-2018-06-05
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly-2018-06-05
```
If you having trouble with "nightly-2018-06-05" version, try to update to the latest one and provide target info:
```bash
$ rustup toolchain install nightly
$ rustup update
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

#### Install dependencies
To automate donwloading and installation of _js-cardano-wasm_ dependency run _setup_cardano_crypto.sh_ to download latest _js-cardano-wasm_ repository into _js-cardano-wasm_ folder.
```bash
$ sh setup_cardano_crypto.sh
```
To install other Yoroi-frontend related dependencies use:
```bash
$ npm install
```

#### Build dlls
```bash
$ npm run build-dll
```

## Build Yoroi Chrome extension

Extension can be built for both the Cardano mainnet and testnet:

- Mainnet
```bash
# build files to './build'
$ npm run build -- --env "mainnet" 
```

- Testnet
```bash
# build files to './build'
$ npm run build -- --env "testnet" 
```

## Run Yoroi Chrome extension
Easy 3 STEPS:
1. Open new webpage with _chrome://extensions_
2. Turn on the developer mode
3. Press "Load unpacked" button and open _build_ folder of your project. Then your app should be ready to use.


## Development

1) *if you switched git branches and it may have affected translation files*, you need to [rebuild the translation cache on your machine](app/i18n/README.md)
2) Run the following
```bash
# build dll dependencies
$ npm run build-dll
# build files to './dev'
# start webpack development server
$ npm run dev
# or
$ npm run start -- --env "development"
```
* If you're developing Inject page, please allow `https://localhost:3000` connections. (Because `injectpage` injected GitHub (https) pages, so webpack server procotol must be https.)
* [Load unpacked extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) 

  Extensions that you download from the Chrome Web Store are packaged up as .crx files, which is great for distribution, but not so great for development. Recognizing this, Chrome gives you a quick way of loading up your working directory for testing. Let's do that now.

  Visit `chrome://extensions` in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox:  The menu's icon is three horizontal bars. and select Extensions under the More Tools menu to get to the same place).

  Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.

  Click Load unpacked extensionâ€¦ to pop up a file-selection dialog.

  Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live (`./dev` folder), and select it.


### Dev Features

 - Hot reloading React (Using [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) and [React Transform](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform))
 - Write code with ES2015+ syntax (Using [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel))
 - E2E tests of Window & Popup & Inject pages (Using [Chrome Driver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromedriver), [Selenium Webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver))

 ### Dev Setup

 We recommend running Visual Studio Code on Ubuntu
 
 Download the [Flow plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flowtype.flow-for-vscode) for VS Code and change the following workspace settings:
 1) `javascript.validate.enable` to `false`
 1) `flow.useNPMPackagedFlow` to `true`

## Compress

This tasks allow to generate compressed bundles (zip and crx).

**Note**: The same `--env` flag should be used as for the build.

### Zip

Zip files can be uploaded to the Chrome Web Store

```bash
# compress build folder to {manifest.name}.zip and crx
$ npm run build -- --env "${network}"
$ npm run compress -- --env "${network}" --zip-only --app-id "APP_ID" --codebase "https://www.sample.com/dw/yoroi-extension.crx"
```

### CRX

Crx are compressed and signed chrome extension bundles

```bash
# compress build folder to {manifest.name}.zip and crx
$ npm run build -- --env "${network}"
$ npm run compress -- --env "${network}" --app-id "APP_ID" --codebase "https://www.sample.com/dw/yoroi-extension.crx" --key ./production-key.pem
```

#### Options

If you want to build `crx` file (auto update), please provide options, and add `update.xml` file url in [manifest.json](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate#update_url manifest.json).

* --app-id: your extension id (can be get it when you first release extension)
* --key: your private key path (default: './key.pem')  
  you can use `npm run compress-keygen` to generate private key `./key.pem`
* --codebase: your `crx` file url

See [autoupdate guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate) for more information.

## Test

* `features`: E2E tests (use [chromedriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromedriver), [selenium-webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver))

```bash
# flow
$ npm run flow
# lint
$ npm run eslint
# features (command to run all existing tests)
$ npm run test-e2e
# How to run one .feature file (One feature file = one covered component from youtrack)
$ npm run test-by-feature feature/wallet-creation.feature
# How to run one test. Instead of '@it-10' you can use any tag from youtrack
$ npm run test-by-tag @it-10
```

 

## Update Cardano crypto library

In order to update it run the following commands:

```bash
# Update js-cardano-wasm
cd js-cardano-wasm;
git checkout master;
git pull origin master;
cd ..;

# Commit the update
git add .
git commit -S -m "${youCommitMessage}"
git push ...

# Re-install the module
$ npm run build-js-cardano-wasm 
$ npm install

# At this point you can go back to Development steps. 
```
